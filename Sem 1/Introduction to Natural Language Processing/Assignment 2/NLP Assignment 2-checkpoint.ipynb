    "PRE-PROCESSING IN NLP :\n",
    "In Information Retrieval, preprocessing simplifies the understanding of the query. In Preprocessing, the length of the material is shortened to improve the performance of the system. There are various techniques to simplify the format of the given query. Following are the approach and benefits of the techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-> Tokenization: - Tokenization helps to split the query into small tokens. For splitting the queries into tokens different methods are applied. The main advantage of tokenization is to remove the noise causing words, symbols, and the numbers that may affect the accuracy of query. Benefit of the technique is that the tokens helps in learning and also defining the meaning of the text by analyze the order of words. This method can be in two types:\n",
    "Given document: Yashashree is a good student. She is studious and hardworking.\n",
    "Type 1: Tokenizing given document in sentence: \n",
    "-> \"Yashashree is a good student\" \"She is studious and hardworking\"\n",
    "Type 2: Tokenizing given document into separate words:\n",
    "-> \"Yashashree\" \"is\" \"a\" \"good\" \"student\" \"She\" \"is\" \"studious\" \"and\" \"hardworking\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2-> Lemmatization: - Lemmatization is similar to stemming, i.e. it also converts a complex word into its root form. The minor difference between both is that lemmatization ensures that the word belongs to its language. We get relevant word when we use this technique. For example:\n",
    "-“There are different types of bats which are hanging on the racks.” \n",
    "-> “There are different type of bat which are hang on the rack”.\n",
    "Here, “types -> type”, “bats -> bat”, “hanging hang”, “racks -> rack” i.e. the given words in the document are converted into the root form.\n",
    " The benefit of this technique is that the lemma algorithm knows that “worse” is derived from the word “bad” and in stemming “worse” root form shown would be “wor” or something similar to it.\n",
    " \n",
    "3-> Removal of Hyphens/Punctuation Marks: - Hyphens/punctuation marks are treated differently. The full sentence with the hyphens/punctuation marks may be used, or they may not be used. Also, in some models, the hyphen/punctuation marks is omitted or even changed with a space. The benefit of the technique is that by removing hyphens/ punctuations we don’t get a similar word repeatedly. For example, if we don’t use this technique then; “Their’s -> Theirs”, “They? -> They” are treated separately.\n",
